# Brain-Tumour-MR-Images-Classification
This repository contains the code for my MSC project on the classification of brain tumor types from MR Images using EfficientNets. The project focuses on utilizing EfficientNets, a family of efficient convolutional neural network architectures, to classify different types of brain tumors based on MR Images.
